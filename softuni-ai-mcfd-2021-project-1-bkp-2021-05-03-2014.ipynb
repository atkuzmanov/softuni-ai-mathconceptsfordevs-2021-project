    "We can see that vector A to B are related because vector B can be achieved by scaling (multiplying) the vector A by 2. This is because 2 x [10,10] = [20,20]. This is the address of Bob. Vector C also represents the movement for A to reach B.\n",

    "We learned from the introduction above that large set of data can be represented as a matrix and we need to somehow compress the columns of the sparse matrix to speed up our calculations. Plus if we multiply a matrix by a vector then we achieve a new vector. The multiplication of a matrix by a vector is known as transformation matrices.\n",

    "**We can transform and change matrices into new vectors by multiplying a matrix with a vector. The multiplication of the matrix by a vector computes a new vector. This is the transformed vector.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Sometimes, the new transformed vector is just a scaled form of the original vector. This means that the new vector can be re-calculated by simply multiplying a scalar (number) to the original vector; just as in the example of vector A and B above.\n",

    "- And other times, the transformed vector has no direct scalar relationship with the original vector which we used to multiply to the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the new transformed vector is just a scaled form of the original vector then the original vector is known to be an eigenvector of the original matrix. Vectors that have this characteristic are special vectors and they are known as eigenvectors. Eigenvectors can be used to represent a large dimensional matrix.**\n",

    "Therefore, if our input is a large sparse matrix M then we can find a vector o that can replace the matrix M. The criteria is that the product of matrix M and vector o should be the product of vector o and a scalar n:\n",

To elaborate, one of the key methodologies to improve efficiency in computationally intensive tasks is to reduce the dimensions after ensuring most of the key information is maintained. Hence, one eigenvalue and eigenvector are used to capture key information that is stored in a large matrix. This technique can also be used to improve the performance of data churning components.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Component analysis is one of the key strategies that is utilised to reduce dimension space without losing valuable information.

    "## What is PCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the number of variables of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea of principal component analysis (PCA) is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data set. This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the principal components (PCs), which are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example lets say that we have 15 dimensions but we can only view a 3 dimensional (3D) space. PCA solves this for us by reducing the dimensions from 15 to 3. Another example is reducing a 3D image to its first 2 principal components and plotting the 3D as a 2D image.\n",

    "Let’s say that you want to predict what the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States will be for 2017. You have lots of information available: the U.S. GDP for the first quarter of 2017, the U.S. GDP for the entirety of 2016, 2015, and so on. You have any publicly-available economic indicator, like the unemployment rate, inflation rate, and so on. You have U.S. Census data from 2010 estimating how many Americans work in each industry and American Community Survey data updating those estimates in between each census. You know how many members of the House and Senate belong to each political party. You could gather stock price data, the number of IPOs occurring in a year, and how many CEOs seem to be mounting a bid for public office. Despite being an overwhelming number of variables to consider, this just scratches the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you have a lot of variables to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve worked with a lot of variables before, you know this can present problems. Do you understand the relationships between each variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask the question, \"How do I take all of the variables I’ve collected and focus on only a few of them?\" In technical terms, you want to \"reduce the dimension of your feature space.\"\n",

    "- Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature elimination** is what it sounds like: we reduce the feature space by eliminating features. In the GDP example above, instead of considering every single variable, we might drop all variables except the three we think will best predict what the U.S.’s gross domestic product will look like. Advantages of feature elimination methods include simplicity and maintaining interpretability of your variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a disadvantage, though, you gain no information from those variables you’ve dropped. If we only use last year’s GDP, the proportion of the population in manufacturing jobs per the most recent American Community Survey numbers, and unemployment rate to predict this year’s GDP, we’re missing out on whatever the dropped variables could contribute to our model. By eliminating features, we’ve also entirely eliminated any benefits those dropped variables would bring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature extraction**, however, doesn’t run into this problem. Say we have ten independent variables. In feature extraction, we create ten \"new\" independent variables, where each \"new\" independent variable is a combination of each of the ten \"old\" independent variables. However, we create these new independent variables in a specific way and order these new variables by how well they predict our dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might say, \"Where does the dimensionality reduction come into play?\" Well, we keep as many of the new independent variables as we want, but we drop the \"least important ones.\" Because we ordered the new variables by how well they predict our dependent variable, we know which variable is the most important and least important.

Yes, it’s approximately the line that matches the purple marks because it goes through the origin and it’s the line in which the projection of the points (red dots) is the most spread out.

    "The three classes in the Iris dataset are:\n",

    "2. Iris-versicolor (n=50)\n",
    "3. Iris-virginica (n=50)\n",

    "And the four features of in Iris dataset are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sepal length in cm\n",

Since PCA yields a feature subspace that maximizes the variance along the axes, it makes sense to standardize the data, especially, if it was measured on different scales. Although, all features in the Iris dataset were measured in centimeters, let us continue with the transformation of the data onto unit scale (mean=0 and variance=1)."

The determinant of a matrix A is denoted $det(A)$, $det A$, or $|A|$.\n",

Thus it makes sense to subtract two points of the space, giving a translation vector, but it does not make sense to add two points of the space. Likewise, it makes sense to add a displacement vector to a point of an **affine space**, resulting in a new point translated from the starting point by that vector.\n",

When considered as a point, the zero vector is called the origin. Adding a fixed vector to the elements of a linear subspace of a vector space produces an affine subspace.

This requires a systematic transformation of the latitudes and longitudes of locations from the surface of the globe into locations on a plane. All projections of a sphere on a plane necessarily distort the surface in some way and to some extent. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are acceptable and others are not; therefore, different map projections exist in order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense of other properties. The study of map projections is the characterization of the distortions. There is no limit to the number of possible map projections. Projections are a subject of several pure mathematical fields, including differential geometry, projective geometry, and manifolds. However, \"map projection\" refers specifically to a cartographic projection.\n",
